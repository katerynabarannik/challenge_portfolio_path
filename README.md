# Task 1: Software configuration
## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?

Hello, my name is **Kateryna**. I took part in this project because i have a strong desire to grow and improve in the field of Quality Assurance. I think that this challenge will help me enhance and re-structure gained knowledge, and, finally, find a QA job ðŸ™‚


I am really excited to start my learning path in Automation!

### *Wish me a good luck!*
